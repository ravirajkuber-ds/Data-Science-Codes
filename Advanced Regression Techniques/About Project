A  housing company named XYZ Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their 
actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict 
the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
